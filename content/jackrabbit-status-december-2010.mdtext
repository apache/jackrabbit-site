Title: Jackrabbit Status December 2010
Apache Jackrabbitâ„¢ is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

## Legal / Branding

We have updated our project branding to match the new branding guidelines
except for a few details that still need to be discussed on trademarks@.

## Community / Development

No new committers were added in this quarter, but a few old committers have
become active again and we're seeing good levels of activity from other
contributors.

Day Software, the employer of many Jackrabbit committers, was recently
acquired by Adobe. We expect this acquisition to have little impact on
their contributions to Jackrabbit.

## Infrastructure

We are currently using a Confluence wiki for managing our project web site,
but would like to migrate to an alternative system. The most promising
alternatives are the new CMS or an svnpubsub-based site built with Maven.
