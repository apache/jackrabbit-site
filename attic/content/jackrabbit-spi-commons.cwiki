This is the SPI Commons component of the Apache Jackrabbit project. This component contains a number of general-purpose classes for use with SPI implementations: This also includes default implementations for the various *Info interfaces and for those interfaces that define the internal representation of JCR names, paths and Item identifiers.

In addition this component provides utilities used to convert JCR name and path Strings as well as values to their corresponding SPI representation.
