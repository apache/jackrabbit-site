Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit Core -- Version 1.4.1

h2. Introduction

This is the 1.4.1 patch release of the jackrabbit-core component of Apache Jackrabbit, a fully conforming implementation of the Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR).

This release fixes a binary property regression (JCR-1346) as well as other issues reported against the Apache Jackrabbit 1.4 release. See below for a full list of changes in this release.

The source archive contains the full source code of this release in a "jackrabbit-core-1.4.1" directory. Use the following commands (or the equivalent in your environment) to build the component with Maven 2 and Java 1.4 or higher:

{code}
$ jar xf jackrabbit-core-1.4.1-src.jar
$ cd jackrabbit-1.4.1
$ mvn install
{code}

*Pre-compiled binary (jackrabbit-core-1.4.1.jar)*
