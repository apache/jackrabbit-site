## Community / Development

Bart van der Schans and Justin Edelson joined the Jackrabbit team as
committers and PMC members.

We adopted an even/odd versioning scheme for stable/unstable releases and
started cutting unstable 2.3.x releases directly from trunk. A stable 2.4.0
release and the accompanying stable 2.4 maintenance branch is planned for
January 2012.

The end of life of Jackrabbit 1.x was announced, with 1.6.5 being the last
1.x release we plan to make.

Active work on the new microkernel prototype targeting Jackrabbit 3.0
continues.
