Jackrabbit Status June 2008
===========================
Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.


Releases
--------
Since the last report we made a number of small component releases and one
older maintenance release. The releases were:

* March 26, 2008: jackrabbit-core 1.4.2
* April 2, 2008: jackrabbit-jcr-commons 1.4.2
* April 9, 2008: jakcrabbit-jcr-rmi 1.4.1
* May 8, 2008: Apache Jackrabbit 1.3.4
* May 8, 2008: jackrabbit-core 1.4.3
* May 9, 2008: jackrabbit-core 1.4.4
* June 9, 2008: jackrabbit-core 1.4.5


Legal
-----
The license issue noted in the previous report (external party using our
code without proper attribution) has been resolved.

We have been clarifying our LICENSE and NOTICE files based on recent
discussions on legal-discuss@ and the incubating sling-dev@ mailing lists.


Community
---------
Esteban Franqueiro and Alexander Klimetschek became committers and PMC
members of Apache Jackrabbit.

Many members of our community attended ApacheCon EU and we also organized a
free-for-everyone JCR community gathering along the conference.


Development
-----------
We are working towards Jackrabbit 1.5 in near future and Jackrabbit 2.0
(and the JSR 283 reference implementation) later on.


Infrastructure
--------------
We switched to Hudson for our CI builds.

We requested and got FishEye indexing for our codebase.

The svn.eu.apache.org mirror is much appreciated as most of our committers
are based in Europe.
