Jackrabbit Status December 2011
===============================
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API (JCR,
specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

Community / Development
-----------------------
Bart van der Schans and Justin Edelson joined the Jackrabbit team as
committers and PMC members.

We adopted an even/odd versioning scheme for stable/unstable releases and
started cutting unstable 2.3.x releases directly from trunk. A stable 2.4.0
release and the accompanying stable 2.4 maintenance branch is planned for
January 2012.

The end of life of Jackrabbit 1.x was announced, with 1.6.5 being the last
1.x release we plan to make.

Active work on the new microkernel prototype targeting Jackrabbit 3.0
continues.


Infrastructure
--------------
We started working on migrating from Confluence to the new CMS.
