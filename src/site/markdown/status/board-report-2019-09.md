Apache Jackrabbit: Board Report September 2019 (DRAFT)
==============================================

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained. 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the main development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

We made our 8th feature release of Jackrabbit Oak (1.16) end of July. 

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

The project stopped supporting Jackrabbit releases from the old
2.10 branch and encouraged users to upgrade to more recent stable
versions (https://s.apache.org/c2a1d).

Four new committers were added to the project and added to the PMC in
the last 3 months. There is an increased interest in the filevault
components, visible in higher JIRA activity and mailing list discussions
on that topic.

A hackathon planned for August was canceled because very few participants
registered and no proposals were submitted for the hackathon
(https://s.apache.org/i8be9).

## Health report: 
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
features and improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.
