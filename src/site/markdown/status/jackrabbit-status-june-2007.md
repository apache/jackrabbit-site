Jackrabbit Status June 2007
===========================
_From the [minutes](http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2007/board_minutes_2007_06_20.txt) of the Apache board meeting on July 20th, 2007:_

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.


Releases
--------
Apache Jackrabbit 1.3 was released in April.

We are currently working on the 1.3.1 release, and initial planning for a
1.4 release later this year and 2.0 next year has begun.


Community
---------
Christophe Lombart was added as a committer and PMC member.

An object-content mapping tool was successfully moved from the incubating
Graffito project into a Jackrabbit subproject.

Jackrabbit received lots of attention in ApacheCon EU where we had one
tutorial and one normal session on Jackrabbit and JCR. A Jackrabbit BOF
session also took place, although it ended up being quite unstructured.

We have two Google Summer of Code projects in progress this summer. Both
projects have been relatively quiet so far, but hopefully we'll get them up
to speed soon.

Jacco van Weert has announced a nice JCR Controller tool on the user
mailing list and is interested in bringing it to Jackrabbit through the
Apache Incubator.


Development
-----------
Jackrabbit is being actively developed on a number of fronts. Increasing
numbers of good patches are coming in, and various technical and
architectural issues are being actively debated on the mailing lists.

The public draft of the upcoming JCR 2.0 specification will probably be
soon released by JSR 283. We are planning to use the public draft as the
main requirements document when implementing the changes and new features
required to make Jackrabbit 2.0 the reference implementation of JSR 283.
