Jackrabbit Status March 2011
============================
Apache Jackrabbit™ is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java™ Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.


Releases
--------
We made three Jackrabbit 2.2.x patch releases in this quarter:

* Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.4 on February 15th
* Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.2 on January 26th
* Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.1 on January 11th


Legal / Branding
----------------
No open issues.


Community / Development
-----------------------
Our efforts to better identify key contributors and offer them
committership are starting to bear fruit. In this quarter Berry van
Halderen and Thomas Draier joined us as committers and PMC members, and we
are expecting to welcome more members soon.

We are happy to see Apache Chemistry reach TLP status, and contributed a
supporting quote to the press release about their graduation.


Infrastructure
--------------
We have consensus on moving our web site from Confluence to the new CMS,
but have yet to start the migration.
