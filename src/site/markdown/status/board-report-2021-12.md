Apache Jackrabbit: Board Report December 2021 (draft)
=============================================

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained.
 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding 
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Project Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the main development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

We continue making regular maintenance releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The
most recent release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.6.22 made available on
November 19th. According to planned release schedule of the project,
the next feature release for Jackrabbit Oak is long overdue. The
majority of Jackrabbit Oak users and committers seems to be using
maintenance releases or 3rd party builds created from trunk, reducing
the need for new feature releases.

The PMC decided to retire the Jackrabbit Oak 1.4 maintenance branch.
There will be no more releases from this branch. Users of 1.4.x are
encouraged to use 1.40.0 or 1.22.8 instead.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

## Community Health:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic mostly on
the JIRA issues and GitHub pull requests reflecting the activity of
the respective component. 

Commit activity is moderate, mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
features and improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.
