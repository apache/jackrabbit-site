Apache Jackrabbit: Board Report June 2021 (draft)
==============================================

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained.
 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding 
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Project Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the main development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

We continue making regular feature releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The
most recent release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.40.0 that was made available
on June 3rd.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

Beginning of May the team decided to drop support and deprecate
the 2.12 branch of Apache Jackrabbit. Users are encouraged to upgrade
to the latest stable versions 2.20 for Java 8 and 2.14 for Java 7
(https://s.apache.org/lm1f3).

The team is preparing a migration of the Apache Jackrabbit Oak code base
from SVN to Git. The vote for the migration happened on the oak-dev
list (https://s.apache.org/mzrnx).

## Community Health:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic mostly on
the dev lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev lists as well
as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
features and improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.
