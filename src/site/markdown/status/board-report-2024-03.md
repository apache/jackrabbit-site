Apache Jackrabbit: Board Report March 2024 (draft)
==============================================

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained.

Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class websites and other demanding 
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications, and it 
is not a reference implementation. 

## Project Status: 
The project is ongoing with moderate activity.

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Jackrabbit was founded 2006-03-15 (18 years ago).

There are currently 59 committers and 59 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1, because all committers automatically
become PMC members.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Nuno Santos on 2023-11-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Nuno Santos on 2023-11-13.

## Project Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the main development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

The project website sources were migrated from SVN to Git in January.
Due to its size, the generated website content still resides in SVN.

In January the team voted to require Java 11 for the next feature
release of Apache Jackrabbit (2.22.0).

RMI support in Apache Jackrabbit was deprecated in February and the
feature will be removed in the next feature release.

## Community Health:
The project is generally healthy with a continuous stream of traffic
mostly on JIRA issues and GitHub pull requests reflecting activity of
the respective component. 

Commit activity is moderate, mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
features and improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.
