Jackrabbit Status April 2006
============================
_From the [minutes](http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2006/board_minutes_2006_04_26.txt) of the Apache board meeting on April 26th, 2006:_

Over the past month, Apache Jackrabbit completed its graduation from
incubator, moved to its new home at jackrabbit.apache.org, and made our big
1.0 release using the mirrors.

The only thing of board interest is that we have implemented the file
header proposed on legal-discuss last year.
