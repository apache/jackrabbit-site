Jackrabbit Status March 2006
============================
_From the [minutes](http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2006/board_minutes_2006_03_15.txt) of the Apache board meeting on March 15th, 2006:_

Jackrabbit accomplished its first official incubating release with version
0.9 of the Apache Jackrabbit reference implementation and JCR-RMI tools.
Day Software has confirmed that the version 0.9 jars have passed the JCR
1.0 TCK with the current exclude list.

We are now getting reorganized for graduation from the Incubator to our own
top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation. The Jackrabbit
committers voted on March 11, 2006, to request graduation. In addition, we
made a call to refresh the list of active committers for an accurate
presentation to the board; Stefano Mazzocchi, Gianugo Rabellino, Tim
Reilly, and Andrew Savory have requested emeritus status, meaning that they
won't be listed on the initial project management committee but are welcome
to come back if they choose to rejoin the project at a later time.
