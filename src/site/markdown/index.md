Welcome to Apache Jackrabbit
============================

The Apache Jackrabbitâ„¢ content repository is a fully conforming implementation 
of the Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in 
[JSR 170](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170) and [JSR 283](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283)).

A content repository is a hierarchical content store with support for
structured and unstructured content, full text search, versioning,
transactions, observation, and more.

[Jackrabbit Oak](/oak) is a complementary implementation of the JCR specification. 
It is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content 
repository for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and 
other demanding content applications. See the [Jackrabbit Oak](/oak) website for 
more information.

Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/)
