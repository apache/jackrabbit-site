Welcome to Apache Jackrabbit
============================

The Apache Jackrabbitâ„¢ content repository is a fully conforming implementation
of the Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in
[JSR 170](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170) and [JSR 283](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283)).

A content repository is a hierarchical content store with support for
structured and unstructured content, full text search, versioning,
transactions, observation, and more.

[Jackrabbit Oak](/oak) is a complementary implementation of the JCR specification.
It is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
repository for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and
other demanding content applications. See the [Jackrabbit Oak](/oak) website for
more information.

Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/)

#### February 19th, 2020: CVE-2020-1940: Apache Jackrabbit Oak sensitive information disclosure vulnerability (updated)
We just fixed a recently reported vulnerability in Apache Jackrabbit Oak:
The optional [initial password change and password expiration features](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/security/user/expiry.html) are prone to a
sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. The code mandates the changed password to
be passed as an additional attribute to the credentials object but does not remove it upon
processing during the first phase of the authentication. In combination with additional,
independent authentication mechanisms, this may lead to the new password being disclosed.
Mitigation: 1.12.0 - 1.22.0 should be upgraded to [1.24.0](downloads.html#latest). 1.10.x should be upgraded to [1.10.8](downloads.html#oak1.10).
1.8.x should be upgraded to [1.8.20](downloads.html#oak1.8).
1.6.x should be upgraded to [1.6.20](downloads.html#oak1.6).

are available and releases will follow. See [OAK-8870](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-8870)
