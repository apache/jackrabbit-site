Jackrabbit Roadmap
==================
This is a roadmap of future Apache Jackrabbit releases and features. See [the dev@ list](mailing-lists.html)
for the latest status.


Unstable/stable release model
-----------------------------
Starting with Jackrabbit 2.3 we have adopted a "Linux-style"
unstable/stable release model with odd/even minor version numbers used to
mark the status of a release.

* [Jackrabbit 2.17 (trunk)](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.17))

Unstable 2.17.x releases will be cut directly from
Jackrabbit trunk, the latest stable branch is 2.16.

Maintenance branches
--------------------
We currently support the following maintenance branches:

* [Jackrabbit 2.16](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.16/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.16)) - recommended version for Java 8 and newer
* [Jackrabbit 2.14](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.14/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.14)) - recommended version for Java 7
* [Jackrabbit 2.12](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.12/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.12)) - recommended version for Java 6 - "end of life" planned for Spring 2021
* [Jackrabbit 2.10](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.10/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.10)) - "end of life" planned for Spring 2019
* [Jackrabbit 2.8](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.8/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.8)) - "end of life" planned for Spring 2020

Users of 2.8 and 2.10 should consider upgrading to the newest stable branch applicable for the Java version in use.

End of life
-----------
The following branches have reached "end of life":

* [Jackrabbit 2.6](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.6/)
* [Jackrabbit 2.4](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.4/)
* [Jackrabbit 2.2](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.2/)
* [Jackrabbit 2.1](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.1/)
* [Jackrabbit 2.0](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.0/)
