Jackrabbit Roadmap
==================
This is a roadmap of future Apache Jackrabbit releases and features. See [the dev@ list](mailing-lists.html)
for the latest status.


Unstable/stable release model
-----------------------------
Starting with Jackrabbit 2.3 we have adopted a "Linux-style"
unstable/stable release model with odd/even minor version numbers used to
mark the status of a release.

* [Jackrabbit 2.19 (trunk)](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.19)) (soon to be 2.21)

Unstable 2.21.x releases will be cut directly from
Jackrabbit trunk, the latest stable branch is 2.20.

Maintenance branches
--------------------
We currently support the following maintenance branches:

* [Jackrabbit 2.20](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.20/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.20)) - recommended version for Java 8 and newer
* [Jackrabbit 2.18](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.18/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.18)) - recommended version for Java 8 to Java 13
* [Jackrabbit 2.16](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.16/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.16)) - from Java 8 up to Java 13 - "end of life" planned for Spring 2023
* [Jackrabbit 2.14](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.14/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.14)) - recommended version for Java 7 - "end of life" planned for Spring 2022
* [Jackrabbit 2.12](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.12/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.12)) - recommended version for Java 6 - "end of life" planned for Spring 2021
* [Jackrabbit 2.8](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/2.8/) ([download](downloads.html#v2.8)) - "end of life" planned for Spring 2020

Users of 2.8 should consider upgrading to the newest stable branch applicable for the Java version in use.
