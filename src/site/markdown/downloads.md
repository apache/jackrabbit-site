Release Archive
---------------
Only current recommended releases are available on the main distribution
site and its mirrors. Older releases are available from the [archive download site](http://archive.apache.org/dist/jackrabbit/).


<a class='anchor' name='verify'></a>
Verify
------

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP signatures or SHA1 and SHA512 checksums. 
Please read [Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases](http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html) for more information 
on why you should verify our releases.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the [KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/jackrabbit/KEYS)
file as well as the `.asc` signature files for the relevant release packages. Make sure you get these files from 
the [main distribution directory](https://www.apache.org/dist/jackrabbit/), rather than from a mirror. 

Then verify the signatures using

    % pgpk -a KEYS
    % pgpv jackrabbit-X.Y.Z-src.zip.asc

or

    % pgp -ka KEYS
    % pgp jackrabbit-X.Y.Z-src.zip.asc

or

    % gpg --import KEYS
    % gpg --verify jackrabbit-X.Y.Z-src.zip.asc


Alternatively, you can verify the SHA1 or SHA512 checksums on the files. For checking the SHA1 or SHA512 checksums, use the programs 
called `sha1sum` or `sha512sum` ([GNU core utilities](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)), or, alternatively, `openssl`.
Windows users can use 'CertUtil` ([doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil))
or use the equivalent *nix tools as part of their Cygwin or Linux subsystems.
