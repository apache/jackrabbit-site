Title: Jackrabbit Status September 2011
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API (JCR,
specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

No open issues.

## Community / Development

No new committers or PMC members were added since our last report.

Apache Jackrabbit was nominated for the 2011 [Swiss Open Source Award](http://www.ossaward.ch/)
 in the community category. We attended the award ceremony on Tuesday, Sep
13th, and gave a short presentation about Jackrabbit, but the award went to
another project.

We are planning to cut the Jackrabbit 2.3.0 release from trunk in near
future. To increase the rate at which latest work in the trunk gets
released (it is already nine months since Jackrabbit 2.2), we are
considering an odd/even versioning strategy where all odd releases like
2.3.x are cut directly from trunk, and stable maintenance branches like
2.4.x get created every now and then for production-ready releases.

Meanwhile we will be cutting new patch releases from earlier maintenance
branches, including the old 1.6 branch whose end of life status will be
announced along with the last patch release. Also, active work on the new
microkernel prototype targeting Jackrabbit 3.0 continues.

## Infrastructure

The planned migration from Confluence to the new CMS soon is still pending
for action on our part.
