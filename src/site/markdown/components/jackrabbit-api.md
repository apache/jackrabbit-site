Jackrabbit API
==============
This is the API component of the Apache Jackrabbit project. This component
contains the interface extensions that Apache Jackrabbit supports in
addition to the standard JCR API. You can use these interfaces to access
Jackrabbit-specific functionality.

Note that the development of these interfaces has moved over to the
Jackrabbit Oak project.
