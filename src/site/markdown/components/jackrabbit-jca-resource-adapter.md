Jackrabbit JCA Resource Adapter
===============================
This is the JCA Resource Adapter component of the Apache Jackrabbit
project. This component packages the Jackrabbit content repository as a JCA
1.0 resource adapter. The packaged adapter can be deployed on a wide range
of application servers.

The Jackrabbit content repository embedded in the JCA package is started
when first accessed and shut down when the adapter is un- or re-deployed.
