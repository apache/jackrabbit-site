Jackrabbit JCR Tests
====================
This is the JCR Tests component of the Apache Jackrabbit project. This
component contains a set of JCR API test cases designed for testing the
compliance of an implementation. Note that although this code base is used
also for the official JCR TCK, this is not the official TCK and passing the
test of this component can not be used as an indication of API compliance.
