Jackrabbit SPI Commons
======================
This is the SPI Commons component of the Apache Jackrabbit project. This
component contains a number of general-purpose classes for use with SPI
implementations: This also includes default implementations for the various
`*Info` interfaces and for those interfaces that define the internal
representation of JCR names, paths and Item identifiers.

In addition this component provides utilities used to convert JCR name and
path Strings as well as values to their corresponding SPI representation.
