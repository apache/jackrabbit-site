Getting Started with Apache Jackrabbit
======================================
To get started with Jackrabbit you should first become familiar with the
JCR API. Download the [JSR 170 specification](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr170/index.html), 
browse the [API documentation](http://www.day.com/maven/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0/), 
check our introduction to JCR levels, or read some of the JCR
articles to understand the content repository model that Jackrabbit
implements. You can also take a look at the various JCR and
Jackrabbit applications to get an idea of what to do with a content
repository.

If you are interested in using Jackrabbit, you should check the Jackrabbit
architecture and try out the First Hops examples we have
prepared. You can either download a binary release or build Jackrabbit	   
from sources.

Take a look at the Frequently Asked Questions or browse the	    
archives of the user and development mailing lists (see also the searchable
archives at The Mail Archive, Gmane, and Nabble) for answers to questions
not covered by the documentation pages. See the Mailing Lists page
if you want to subscribe or unsubscribe the Jackrabbit mailing
lists.

Apache Jackrabbit is an open source project and welcomes all
contributions. You can participate by answering questions on the
mailing list, filing bug reports for any problems or improvement ideas	   
you come up with, contributing to the Jackrabbit Wiki, or writing
documentation and code. See the How the ASF works page for background	   
information on the Apache Software Foundation and the way we work.


Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR)
------------------------------------------------
Jackrabbit is a complete implementation of the JCR API, so the        
primary API for Jackrabbit application developers is to be found in
the JCR section of the Documentation.


Jackrabbit architecture and Deployment Models
---------------------------------------------
Find out more about the Jackrabbit Architecture or learn more
about the Jackrabbit deployment Options be it as an embedded
content repository to be delivered with you are application, a
shared repository for example in a J2EE environment or a classical content
repository server setup.


Node Types
----------
To learn about the content modeling system used in Jackrabbit, read the
section on node types.
